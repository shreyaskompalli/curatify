# Curatify: A playlist generation web-app

Curatify allows any Spotify user (with either a Free or Premium account) to create their own custom-generated playlists based on a number of different attributes, seed artists/tracks, and recently played songs. This was accomplished by leveraging Spotify's recommendation engine as well as various other endpoints on the Spotify Web API to gather data about the user, artists, and tracks. The app was primarily created using Express and Node.js for backend integration and Bootstrap, jQuery, and native HTML/CSS for the frontend UI/UX.
